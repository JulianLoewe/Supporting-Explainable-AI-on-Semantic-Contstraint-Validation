The Semantic Web aims to improve the ability of machines to not only represent but understand the data they are processing and storing. At the same time, the data should stay comprehensible to humans, allowing for the cooperation of humans and machines in making decisions. Therefore, technologies are designed to deal with human-understandable data structures, giving their entities a semantic meaning. \cite{berners2002new} 
 
 This section introduces the W3C recommended technologies to perform constraint validation over structured data carrying a semantic meaning and, therefore, is called semantic constraint validation.
