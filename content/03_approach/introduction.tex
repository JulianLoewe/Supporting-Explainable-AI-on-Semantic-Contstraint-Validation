This chapter introduces the problem described in the motivating example more formally. Therefore, the concepts presented in the background section are used. Afterward, the approach to solving the problem is explained in detail, and heuristics are proposed to improve the performance of the approach. The motivating example continues to help the reader understand the approach.
