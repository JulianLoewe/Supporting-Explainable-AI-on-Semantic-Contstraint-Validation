In this section, the aim is to improve the previously presented approach with heuristics to reduce the time needed by the validation engine. First, heuristics are presented to reduce the number of nodes in the knowledge graph, which need to be validated during the SHACL schema validation of the different constraints. In this first section, it is also presented how redundant validation runs for shape schemas used by multiple constraints are avoided. Next, heuristics are worked out to reduce the time spent on joining SHACL schema validation results with the samples in the dataset via the sample-to-node mapping. The third section investigates performing the SHACL constraint validation during SPARQL query processing, which uses the heuristics from the first section to improve the runtime. Finally, a new type of constraint is introduced and distinguished from the old one.
