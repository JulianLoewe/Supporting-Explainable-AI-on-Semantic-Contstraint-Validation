This work contributes a theoretical framework to efficiently validate predictive models using user-defined constraints based on semantic web technologies. The framework exploits the SHACL shape schema validation to make the semantic context of entities usable for the validation of predictive models. In this context, two types of constraints arise:  (i) \emph{Prediction constraints} to explain and check the model's predictions and (ii) \emph{Data constraints} to measure the trustworthiness of the samples in the dataset used to train a predictive model.

Heuristics are proposed for efficiency: SHACL engine agnostic heuristics allow to minimize the number of SHACL validation results needed to be generated. Join heuristics are presented to reduce the time required to align the SHACL schema validation results with the samples in the dataset used for machine learning. 

Based on the constraint validation results generated by the framework, models' predictions can be explained or better interpreted. The way of visualizing decision trees of the \texttt{dtreeviz} library \cite{dtreeviz} with the samples' ground truth distribution is transferred to be usable for the annotation with constraint validation results. The latter allows for increased interpretability. Confusion matrices are decomposed for better interpretability of classifiers' performance. The whole framework is publicly available in the form of a python library\footnote{\href{https://github.com/JulianLoewe/Validating_Models}{https://github.com/JulianLoewe/Validating\_Models}} and is evaluated with respect to efficiency criteria.
